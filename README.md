# Water level detector for a transparent bottle üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Yeetcode

### Project Description
We implemented this project to check if there is any amount of water in a transparent bottle. You can upload images of your bottle and check if it has water or not!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We analyzed that modern society has become so dependent on digital interfaces that the analog task of looking through clear plastic to assess liquid levels has become cognitively overwhelming for 73% of smartphone users.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
This clearly solves the problem stated above (hehe) as well as in a world where people constantly forget whether they've consumed adequate H2O, our revolutionary AI-powered water bottle detection system eliminates the devastating 0.3 seconds of uncertainty when glancing at your bottle. No longer will humanity suffer from the tragic affliction of 'visual water level assessment fatigue.
